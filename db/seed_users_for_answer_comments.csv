He has gotten pretty good at milking; it is much like using vi: the key is remembering how to hold your fingers.</p>

<p>Jacob is the inventor of TDD Karaoke, the wildly popular sport in which contestants are given a suite of tests drawn at random from multiple projects, and have 25 minutes to make them all pass.</p>

<p>Jacob's 2009 essay on how to configure a Rails model to support multiple databases was, through a clerical error, shortlisted for the Booker Prize.  You'd be astonished how often this type of thing happens.</p>

<p>Jacob is Senior Software Engineer at Technolutions, Inc., maker of Slate, an application used by many top universities to manage the admissions process. If you've applied to college or graduate school in the United States recently, you've probably used their code.</p>

At 10, I cut my teeth writing text adventure games in Scheme. In high school, I wrote Mandelbrot set programs on a $10 Commodore 64 from a yard sale, an HP 48 calculator, and a Java 1.0 applet. I've entered 68k machine code by hand into RAM on on a computer I built on a breadboard, and I've implemented an object oriented layer in Scheme for scripting interactive educational multimedia.

<p>I'm retired, and have been for many moons.  My hobbies include woodworking and helping others learn Ruby. </p>

<p><strong>Me, before</strong></p>

<p>In my former life I was, chronologically, a university prof, a government policy advisor, an independent consultant, and a software developer.  The last of these was the result of an idea I had in 1992 for a remote computer backup system.  The concept was to transfer each distinct file but once, even if the file was owned by multiple users (as was the case for program files, which at the time accounted for the lion's share of the occupied space on users' hard drives). This resulted in it being highly economic to perform automatic nightly backups with the technology available at the time (14400 bps modems). I hired three young coders and we set about writing a DOS app in C. After some ups and downs I licensed the software to a company that moved it from DOS to Windows and then to the internet.  A few years later they were acquired (for their one and only product--the remote backup software) by a US software giant.</p>

<p><strong>reputation vs. Reputation</strong></p>

<p>What's most important to you, a good reputation as a Ruby coder, or a high Reputation score at SO? If it's <em>reputation</em> you want, devote your time at SO to helping everyone, yourself included, to gain a better understanding of Ruby. It's as simple as that. The Reputation will come. This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>submit well-crafted questions, answers and comments that are concise, complete and understandable.</li>
<li>if you don't understand a question or answer, ask for an explanation or clarification.</li>
<li>offer answers that are innovative, even when you prefer an answer already posted by someone else (and say so). If it garners no upvotes, but you've learned something in the process, that's enough.</li>
<li>give credit where credit is due, both in awarding upvotes and complementing posters for their questions or answers, including answers to questions that you have answered as well. (Some members seem to feel that awarding an upvote is tantamount to receiving a downvote, which  does not go unnoticed.)</li>
<li>admit when you are wrong, and graciously accept worthwhile suggestions for improving your answers. (Some members--often anti-upvoters--never admit they are wrong. Don't they realize that everyone in the room is looking at them?)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Us, now</strong></p>

<p>My wife, Cynthia, and I live in Victoria, British Columbia (Canada). We have two sons, three grandchildren and a goldendoodle named Saffi. My current avatar shows what I looked like when I was a young man.</p>

<p>I'm a developer in various languages, but most notably Ruby and PHP, shifting more and more in the Ruby direction every day.  I also enjoy playing around with Cocoa on OS X and iOS, but I don't pretend to be an expert.  I have a half-written multi-language text editor in it.  One day I may finish it, though I'm considering writing an Emacs-inspired terminal-based editor in Ruby instead.</p>

<h2>Employment</h2>

<p>Flippa.com Pty. Ltd, Melbourne (scroll down for <strong>opportunities</strong>)</p>

<p><strong>Main technologies:</strong> PHP, quickly &amp; iteratively moving to Ruby, Rails, DataMapper.</p>

<p>I'm the development manager at Flippa.com and spend a lot of time working on stuff for them in my own time, mostly because I love it.  We are currently in a long-term transitional period, migrating our codebase from a bespoke PHP framework to Ruby on Rails.  Seamlessly running the two applications side-by-side poses some interesting problems.</p>

<p>Our biggest ongoing technical challenges revolve around search infrastructure and a fairly complex and ever-evolving bidding system, along with tight integration with many external services.  We spend a large amount of time re-thinking and improving our server infrastructure.  We love exploring new technologies, where they actually make good sense as far as our needs are concerned.</p>

<h2>Job Opportunities</h2>

<p>If you're based in Australia and looking to work in a fun startup environment (we're about 3 years old) in Melbourne, drop me a note either on Twitter (<a href=""http://twitter.com/d11wtq"" rel=""nofollow"">@d11wtq</a>), or via my github profile and we can arrange an interview if we think you're a good fit.  We're always looking for technically-capable junior backend-developers/graduates, experienced backend-developers, and (at the current time) client-side developers.</p>

<p>People who work with us love the atmosphere.  We work in a lively office, shared with our sibling companies (<a href=""http://sitepoint.com"" rel=""nofollow"">SitePoint.com</a>, <a href=""http://99designs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">99designs.com</a>, <a href=""http://wavedigital.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">wavedigital.com.au</a> and <a href=""http://learnable.com"" rel=""nofollow"">learnable.com</a>).  We have flexible working hours, a fridge full of beer and a foosball table.  At the end of every year we all go away together and celebrate in style.  Developers are also given the last 3 days in each month to work on projects of their own choosing.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>

<p>I have a selection of open source projects up on github (<a href=""https://github.com/d11wtq"" rel=""nofollow"">@d11wtq</a>).  Flippa also likes to share (<a href=""https://github.com/flippa"" rel=""nofollow"">@flippa</a>).</p>

<p>I love computer games, especially FPS games on multi-player, cricket, music, racing and adventure.</p>

<p>I am a 24 years old guy and as time is passing by, I am gradually coming to realize that there are so many things to see and do in this beautiful world. I am afraid that a few years down the line I will repent over so many things I wished to do but could not do. However, I have started serious planning for all this. </p>

I'm one of the developers of <a href=""http://2ndquadrant.com/BDR"" rel=""nofollow"">BDR</a>,  the multi-master async replication solution for PostgreSQL, and do a lot of support as well. </p>

<p>I maintain a technical blog at <a href=""http://blog.ringerc.id.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">blog.ringerc.id.au</a>. My PostgreSQL writing now appears on the <a href=""http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">2nd quadrant blog</a>.</p>

<p>I'll work in most programming languages with varying degrees of competence, though I'll only reluctantly touch PHP or Perl code. I'm more interested in the libraries, tools, and the code that's built on top of the language.</p>

<p>Most of my scrap code lives on <a href=""https://github.com/ringerc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ringerc</a> . Most of my open source code is in the form of scattered patches across too many different bugzillas and JIRAs, rather than single new projects. I contribute patches to PostgreSQL and work on BDR.</p>

<p>Most of my contribution is now non-code, in the form of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detailed bug reporting with test cases</li>
<li>User support for PostgreSQL on mailing lists and here on SE</li>
<li>PostgreSQL patch review and beta testing</li>
<li>Usability review</li>
<li>Writing, editing and enhancing documentation, HOWTOs, etc</li>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Passionate with a can-do attitude, I gained experience in designing and crafting front-end and back-end distributed apps. </p>

<p>Familiar with agile methodologies, distributed-development, version control systems, I ensure to apply best practice in a collaborative way to achieve a high level of modularization and quality of artifacts. </p>

<p>Pretty quick with algorithms and problem-solving, I consider testing, code revision, and documentation among my daily tasks. </p>

<p>DevOps is known through the daily tasks and the times when my team needed me. I am working actually on improving my big data and machine learning skills.</p>

<p>Most of my knowledge comes from reading books, blogs, moocs, meetups and learning from those I’ve worked with at the time.</p>

<p>I believe in positive attitude and power of intention and I’m aiming to find balance with everything - way of the middle - especially between brain (rational thinking) and heart (feeling and intuition).</p>

Graduated from Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Engineering in April 2014.</p>

<p>Languages by approximate amount of time I've spent with each (last updated in March 2015):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Objective-C</code>: 6,000 hours (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>Multiple apps on the iOS and Mac App stores.</li>
<li>I love that all arguments are named, but this language often ends up with unwieldy lines. I've yet to see any particularly good style conventions that are easy to read/write and compact for this language. <code>@property</code>, <code>@()</code>, <code>@[]</code>, and <code>@{}</code> were a nice start, but the language still has a long way to go before it even competes in the same readability league as <code>Python</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Python / Boo</code>: 5,000 hours (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>Don't tell the other languages, but this is definitely my favorite one so far. Everything is so compact and easy to read. Plus I love that 90% of tools you need are packaged in the standard library and that the next 9% are easy to install with <code>Pip</code>. Writing that last 1% is easy.</li>
<li><code>Boo</code> is Unity's variation on <code>Python</code>. It's compiled so includes more type safety than standard <code>Python</code>... it's compatible with Mono and .NET.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Java</code>: 2,500 hours (work)

<ul>
<li>I've made web apps, swing apps, and Android apps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>JavaScript / JQuery / UnityScript</code>: 2,000 hours (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>Unity will try telling you their language is <code>JavaScript</code>. It has enough changes that I generally refer to it as its own language, <code>UnityScript</code>. I've made some web games in it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>C++</code>: 500 hours (school and personal)

<ul>
<li>Played around with OGRE 3D (Object Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) before settling on <code>Unity</code>, instead. Also, most class programming assignments called for <code>C++</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>C</code>: 500 hours (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>It's hard to stick a number on this, since often technically the language is actually <code>C++</code> or <code>Obj-C</code>, but the particular task at hand doesn't call for an object oriented solution but a purely functional one, so the only giveaway that it isn't <code>C</code> is the file extension being .cpp, .m, or .mm instead of .c.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Racket / Scheme / LISP</code>: 100 hours (school and personal)

<ul>
<li>I really like how consistent the syntax is. If anyone ever says they don't like these languages, they've either not tried it or they don't understand functional programming. I personally love them and am in the process of writing my own LISP like language, which I call <code>DR</code> (short for <code>D</code>on't <code>R</code>epeat.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Assembly</code>: 20 hours (school and personal)

<ul>
<li>I've used the <code>asm()</code> function to generate random numbers using Intel Secure Key on the newest Intel chips in a <code>C</code> program.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>MatLab</code>: 20 hours (school)</li>
<li><code>Ruby</code>: 5 hours (personal)

<ul>
<li>Did the online introductory tutorial.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

I have been associated with the software industry for the past 5+ years. Over the years I have developed competencies in the following technologies and paradigms: </p>

<ul>
<li>Web Design  </li>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>PHP Site Development</li>
<li>Wordpress Site Development</li>
<li>Joomla Site Development</li>
<li>Js / Jquery /AngularJs</li>
<li>Css / Css3  AJAX Work</li>
<li>XML/JSON</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
</ul>

<p>I find myself to be an adherent believer of the proverb “Never Give Up”. I understand that the world of software engineering is rapidly evolving and is highly competitive. A software engineer needs to be always on his toes to keep up with the emerging trends, styles and technologies of the software industry. I learn fast, adapt quickly and have acquainted myself with many cutting edge development tools. Website Design and Development is not just a profession, for me it is also a passion.</p>

I just wanted to change the color of something, if I recall. That sparked immediate joy, and I never looked back! I created a moderately popular fan page, then in college I went on to learn Flash on my own time, and worked for the Natural Sciences and Mathematics Department part time, creating an animation of a character named Professor Nat and his pet frog named Turtle.</p>

<p>In college, I switched from Computer Science to Political Science. If I could do it all over again, I don't think I'd have made that switch.</p>

<p>In 2005, I had an incredible opportunity to go study Spanish in Costa Rica for a month of total immersion. I lived with a family there, and we traveled to the coast or the mountains each weekend. I road a horse past a live volcano to a waterfall in the forest, and I'll never forget that experience. It was something out of a novel.</p>

<p>After graduating, I made some websites freelance, and then finally found a job continuing to do Flash animations with a small company of one man. We built that company up to 5 employees, and have over one hundred clients. Our main product is a map-based real estate search engine for Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. In that time I learned responsive design, JavaScript, CSS 3.0 and SQL. Plus, with some of our clients using bulletin boards built on PHP, I was introduced to that language.</p>

<p>While we've worked mainly in VB.net for the past 11+ years, I have been learning C# MVC in my own time. I am proficient with UX design and development, especially using jQuery and coding my own server side functions and SQL to build AJAX based web applications.</p>

<p>I'm excited for what the future will bring me, and I'm passionate about learning new coding techniques and languages!</p>

<p>Some of my favorite frameworks/languages to work with are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails - especially for building REST APIs (lots of fun). I think it's really great for prototyping and or ""getting a product to market, quickly"" approach. But I certainly believe that it excels at building a manageable API infrastructure and keeping code down to a very bare minimum while making it easy to version.</li>
<li>JavaScript - After I learned how to use OOP properly with JS, I fell in love with it. Currently messing around with Node.js and Express.</li>
<li>Java - I have been messing around with JavaFX lately and it's pretty cool, especially when used in conjunction with one of my Rails APIs. Have been wanting to check out Scala or Go one of these days.</li>
<li>PHP - particularly interested in the micro-framework approach and PHP 7's speed. It's also what constantly use at work.</li>
<li>Python - really enjoying Python in conjunction with <a href=""http://click.pocoo.org/5/"" rel=""nofollow"">Click</a> for building command-line apps. Much simpler than argparse. With all sincerity, I really love Python for its ease of use and its simplicity. I jokingly refer to it as ""Java made simple"", as it typically does all the thing I want to do in Java, but with a more straightforward approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, I work as a Software Developer at SproutLoud Media Networks in Weston, FL, and love what I do. On a daily basis, I typically reflect on my times being a waiter and delivery boy; from working 13 hour shifts 6 days a week, to doing what I love to do for living. And the best part is I get paid more to do it! I worked very hard to get where I am today and could not be more grateful for how life is going so far. I would even consider myself very grateful to have earned my full time position at the company before graduating college.</p>

<p>As of now, my bucket list looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make an 8-bit computer from scratch</li>
<li>Form a company that does something important</li>
</ul>

<p>And my slightly smaller goals for now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Earn a promotion for honest, good work</li>
<li>Graduate college</li>
<li>Achieve fluency as a software <em>architect</em> (and not just a code monkey)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have worked in a variety of roles over the past ~6 years - sometimes as a ""solo"" developer, or in a small team; and more recently within larger technical organisations. I primarily work on Rails APIs - but have a solid exposure to development across the full web development stack.</p>

<p>At one time or another, I have been in charge of: VM configuration; NGINX settings (including SSL certificate management); email delivery management; AWS administration; Jenkins/continuous integration and delivery configuration; and plenty of unit testing (TDD when possible).</p>

<p>I've also had plenty of exposure to front-end development - such as: (to an extent) application layout/design; CSS; and Javascript/JQuery/CoffeeScript/etc. More recently, I've helped develop larger SPAs using JS Frameworks such as EmberJS; and have started to use Elm in daily workflow.</p>

<p>... But Ruby is what I enjoy working on most. Especially ""Ruby <em>Off</em> Rails"", where the pure language is really elegant to work with.</p>

<p>I taught myself to code in high-school, motivated by the idea of creating my own video game. My interest in video game development quickly shifted into a strong attraction to web technologies. I've spent all of my adult life building software for the web. Most of my career has revolved around startups, leading small fast-paced teams in chaotic environments. I believe anything can be learned, and I feel the constant need to push myself out of my comfort zone. In recent years, I've spent most of my time building products with NodeJS, React, GraphQL and Typescript, working for remote teams and
experimenting with the latest tech in my own side-projects.</p>

<p>I am an experienced, self-motivated and team oriented person, ready to learn and prosper along my way to the peak of professionalism.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why I am good at what I do?</h2>

<p>Achieving best quality of code and always satisfying the customer is number one priority for me. I am an easygoing person, fast learner and a team player. My 4+ years of experience in different companies with all kind of backgrounds, cultures and fields of development thought me very valuable and important lessons and gave me a big progress as a developer. I am well aware of both Back-end and Front-end implementations of an application. I have fully participated in the development cycle  - from the UX, the design, through the technical documentation and development of an application. In addition I have developed a keen eye for design and UX and a good sense for cracks in a system which helps me write better, more bugless, more bulletproof code avoiding problems in the future. I have worked in various teams and on different kind of projects - from social media platforms to various big data content management systems. The different nature of projects helped me evolve both my technical and creative skills as well as my team spirit.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why I can be even better at what I do?</h2>

<p>I always try to extract as much knowledge as possible from the tasks I am given. Learning new interesting technologies and participating in interesting projects is my passion. I love to code as it is one of my hobbies.</p>

<hr>

<h2>My interests?</h2>

<p>I'm a fan of healthy living and sport. Mostly I visit the gym but I like and I try to participate in all kind of sports. I am also interested in different other areas like personal development, finance, entrepreneurship, marketing, photography and others.</p>

<hr>

<h2>My dream?</h2>

<p>My dream is to contribute in some form to the educational system. I believe that education worldwide is in a bad condition and needs improvement. I think that gamification can take an important place in the education of children.</p>

Working there since 9.2016 when got my PhD in the field of chemical physics (soft matter physics). Got master degree in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (applied math and physics).</p>

<p>Before childrenscience participated mostly in FOSS projects (like TiddlyWiki and plugins for it, maintainer of the core since 2018), coded mostly front-end (TiddlyWiki is a SAP, hence HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery), but also have skills in Node.js, C, C++, Python, SQL, basic knowledge of Git, PHP, Apache, some web protocols, GitHub, Jira, Drupal (I was an admin of a couple of corporate sites and corresponding social network pages for approximately a year); also know and deal with Unix, Arduino, do some 3D-modeling and printing (using Blender/Autodesk Fusion 360 + RepRap Prusa i3) and learn prototyping and robotics in a couple of places. Developed a MathQuil plugin for Etherpad (not released yet as a separate plugin). In 2016 participated in ""4 sprints towards Internet of Things"" by Intel. In 2016-2017 participated ""IT-management school"" by CROC incorporated (learning and practicing design-thinking, various agile approaches etc).</p>

<p>I also participate in different educational projects (different summer schools for 1-5th and 7-8th forms, teaching math, physics and electronics; science festivals, showing and discussing physical experiments; taught physics in secondary school for 1 year; tutored a student in math analysis for 1 year; lead some ""engineering"" projects in summer schools [actually those were mostly about creativity and making, not about real engineering]; some other activities). Have some experience in online education workflow as a teacher.</p>

<p>For now I'm not looking for a job, but I'm interested in networking with people who are interested in stuff below. Some fields of prime interest:</p>

<ul>
<li>systemization and representation of human-readable data (especially personal knowledge) and learning through hypertext; UX, front-end</li>
<li>digital workflow in news reading, data collecting, text composing (including scientific articles), human-human communication, collaboration tools</li>
<li>education projects: both online education (exploiting potentials of hypertext and multimedia, design-thinking) and offline (physics and robotics) education (and tools for it, like using hypertext for creating reusable knowledge base for teachers)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Hobbies</h1>

<h2>Double Jump</h2>

<p>I enjoy the double jump. It's exactly like the triple-jump, but with one less. I didn't make it in the 100 m sprint as #1 in the world, so I took up a sport where I was confident I would be the best of the best. Better to be the head of a donkey than the tail of a lion. </p>

<h2>Checking the Documentation</h2>

<p>Another hobby I enjoy vis a vis Microsoft's .net technology is commenting on any errata I find - particularly with respect to punctuation. There, is nothing, more, annoying than a misplaced comma. It's a human rights violation.</p>

<h2>WoW</h2>

<p>I also like playing WoW.</p>

<h2>Beauty Pageant Winner</h2>

<p>I've also won a beauty pageant. But unfortunately I had to forfeit it and go straight to jail without passing go. I still pocketed the $200 though. #BadBoyz4Evaz</p>

<h2>Wait....you're still here?</h2>
