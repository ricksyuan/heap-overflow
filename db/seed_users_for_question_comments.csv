<p>Familiar with agile methodologies, distributed-development, version control systems, I ensure to apply best practice in a collaborative way to achieve a high level of modularization and quality of artifacts. </p>

<p>Pretty quick with algorithms and problem-solving, I consider testing, code revision, and documentation among my daily tasks. </p>

<p>DevOps is known through the daily tasks and the times when my team needed me. I am working actually on improving my big data and machine learning skills.</p>

<p>Most of my knowledge comes from reading books, blogs, moocs, meetups and learning from those Iâve worked with at the time.</p>

I hope I succeed soon, as I feel increased attention in the ORACLE's alternatives. The day that happens I'll be happy, as I'll be paid for my hobby!</p>

<p>I'm also leading a bunch of internal training courses within the company, educating people to use databases properly. PostgreSQL is our training database, although ORACLE is used elsewhere. Feels that I have to learn a lot more then I give to my students, nice experience.</p>
