"35330073","3047117","42","@ArunRaj -- There isn't an easy way to tell which property (or properties) is overriding the crossed-out one. One option is to look in the ""computed"" styles tab to find the same property type, and then if you expand that you should see the source of the various rules that are trying to apply that property (including the one that actually is active). So if you see that ""font-size:11px"" is crossed out, look in the computed properties for ""font-size"", and you should see all of the places that font-size is applied, including the actually active one.

The `before_create` callback is called **after** the _user_ has been served a new object, provided their input, and submitted the object for creation to the controller. The controller then checks for any `before_create` callbacks. It's seems counter-intuitive, but it a nomenclature thing - `before_create` refers to the `create` action.

    klass = Object.const_get ""MyClassName""

-or-

    klass = ""MyClassName"".constantize

Both return the class for whatever brand of fun you're interested in.

While looking around, I also found the Inflector class to be handy for dynamically building class names.

The mechanism protects your controllers, while operating alongside (actually inside) of the Rails session cookie. Without protect_from_forgery, or turning it off or setting an except on it, you are telling Rails NOT to protect that action using the information from the CSRF token (which is taken from the session cookie).","2019-02-16 18:44:06","","3163663"

In that scenario, like a server-to-server communication, this answer is appropriate. HOWEVER, what is confusing to most web app developers is that for a Javascript client, controlled and written by you, you DO NOT WANT TO use a single key-secret (that would expose a single key-secret to all clients). Instead, Rail's CSRF and cookie session mechanism work great— even for Javascript apps that use your API— if you pass the CSRF token back to Rails with each request.","2019-02-16 18:48:41","","3163663"

For those ppl, give unique key-secret pairs via a secure non-hackable mechanism. For modern web applications, where lots of people will load your web app via a web client, you still use a session or token-based mechanism to uniquely identify each person who visits your site. So unless you're using SOME OTHER mechanism to do this (Json Web tokens, etc), stick with Rails' built-in stuff.","2019-02-16 18:53:31","","3163663"
