He has gotten pretty good at milking; it is much like using vi: the key is remembering how to hold your fingers.</p>

<p>Jacob is the inventor of TDD Karaoke, the wildly popular sport in which contestants are given a suite of tests drawn at random from multiple projects, and have 25 minutes to make them all pass.</p>

<p>Jacob's 2009 essay on how to configure a Rails model to support multiple databases was, through a clerical error, shortlisted for the Booker Prize.  You'd be astonished how often this type of thing happens.</p>

<p>Jacob is Senior Software Engineer at Technolutions, Inc., maker of Slate, an application used by many top universities to manage the admissions process. If you've applied to college or graduate school in the United States recently, you've probably used their code.</p>

<p>I work for <a href=""http://www.2ndquadrant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">2nd Quadrant</a>, a global PostgreSQL consultancy. I'm one of the developers of <a href=""http://2ndquadrant.com/BDR"" rel=""nofollow"">BDR</a>,  the multi-master async replication solution for PostgreSQL, and do a lot of support as well. </p>

<p>I maintain a technical blog at <a href=""http://blog.ringerc.id.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">blog.ringerc.id.au</a>. My PostgreSQL writing now appears on the <a href=""http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">2nd quadrant blog</a>.</p>

<p>I'll work in most programming languages with varying degrees of competence, though I'll only reluctantly touch PHP or Perl code. I'm more interested in the libraries, tools, and the code that's built on top of the language.</p>

<p>Most of my scrap code lives on <a href=""https://github.com/ringerc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ringerc</a> . Most of my open source code is in the form of scattered patches across too many different bugzillas and JIRAs, rather than single new projects. I contribute patches to PostgreSQL and work on BDR.</p>

<p>Most of my contribution is now non-code, in the form of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detailed bug reporting with test cases</li>
<li>User support for PostgreSQL on mailing lists and here on SE</li>
<li>PostgreSQL patch review and beta testing</li>
<li>Usability review</li>
<li>Writing, editing and enhancing documentation, HOWTOs, etc</li>
<li>Blogging in detail on topics likely to be useful to others.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've turned into a git fiend and no longer understand why anybody uses anything else. I'm also becoming increasingly obsessive about testing, particularly with the advent of <a href=""http://jenkins-ci.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Jenkins CI</a> and related tools.</p>

I have been associated with the software industry for the past 5+ years. Over the years I have developed competencies in the following technologies and paradigms: </p>

<ul>
<li>Web Design  </li>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>PHP Site Development</li>
<li>Wordpress Site Development</li>

<li>XML/JSON</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
</ul>

<p>I find myself to be an adherent believer of the proverb “Never Give Up”. I understand that the world of software engineering is rapidly evolving and is highly competitive. A software engineer needs to be always on his toes to keep up with the emerging trends, styles and technologies of the software industry. I learn fast, adapt quickly and have acquainted myself with many cutting edge development tools. Website Design and Development is not just a profession, for me it is also a passion.</p>

At 13 I was building websites by hand in HTML and Frontpage 98 (which is how I learned what not to do). Since then I've been a computer addict and programmer.</p>

<p>Avid reader and insatiable learner, I started rearranging bits and bytes to make the computer behave the way I wanted, and help others understand the nonsense technology can be sometimes. Despite this love-hate relationship I've had with computers and the web, it is the thing I am most interested in and passionate about.</p>

<p>I've been developing for the web professionally for 14+ years, and have picked up a smattering of languages, technologies, frameworks and tricks that I use daily to make the best web experiences possible for users.</p>

<p>I am currently a front end programmer and software engineer, specializing in user experiences in Angular, Rails, Javascript, jQuery, CSS, Sass, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, WordPress, and various social APIs, responsive UI, IE8 issues, and a few others. I also have experience in ASP.NET C#, PHP, MySQL, MS SQL, Visual Basic, XML, CakePHP, ColdFusion, Prototype, a little iOS, and a dialect of ZPL (label printer code).</p>

<p>Double Jumper, brother to another mother, Water Cooling Engineer and orange-mocha-frappucinno aficionado. Roughly in that order.</p>

<h1>Hobbies</h1>

<h2>Double Jump</h2>

<p>I enjoy the double jump. It's exactly like the triple-jump, but with one less. I didn't make it in the 100 m sprint as #1 in the world, so I took up a sport where I was confident I would be the best of the best. Better to be the head of a donkey than the tail of a lion. </p>

<h2>Checking the Documentation</h2>

<p>Another hobby I enjoy vis a vis Microsoft's .net technology is commenting on any errata I find - particularly with respect to punctuation. There, is nothing, more, annoying than a misplaced comma. It's a human rights violation.</p>

<h2>WoW</h2>

<p>I also like playing WoW.</p>

<h2>Beauty Pageant Winner</h2>

<p>I've also won a beauty pageant. But unfortunately I had to forfeit it and go straight to jail without passing go. I still pocketed the $200 though. #BadBoyz4Evaz</p>

<h2>Wait....you're still here?</h2>
